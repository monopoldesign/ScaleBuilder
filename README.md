# ScaleBuilder

Based on my implementation of Ian Ring's "A Study of Scales" (https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/) for my OSS-Sequencer, I made a version for Processing using (almost) the same functions, that I have coded for OSS. It also features a simple Synth to play the Scales. The Synth is made using the Beads-Library for Processing.
